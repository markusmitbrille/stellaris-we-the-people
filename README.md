Rebellions will break out based on ethos divergence. When rebellions break out, entire sectors will rebel. Whenever a sector rebels, all other non-core sectors get massive pro-rebellion boosts (which may cause them to rebel themselves, at the same time). If more than one sector rebels at the same time, they form a federation.

Maybe have one rebellion clock variable per planet and increase it every month based on ethics divergence ~~and distance to core sector~~ (not possible, I think)? Doing it per pop, which would have the advantage of taking their happiness and class into account, would probably be too slow.

TODO:
+ Rest of the start unrest events
+ Start rebellion events
+ Prevent rebellions after one broke out recently
+ Massive government ethics attraction for rebel empires
+ Decisions for propaganda/crackdown enabling/disabling
+ Test if setting of unrest variable works correctly (especially for existing savegames)
